## (Please Read) About this Repository

The work for this project has been logged through pull requests. See the assignees of each issue / pull request to view which member(s) worked on a given task. We hope this will make it clear that team members intend to divide work evenly and document the process.

We are aware of the variables being monitored:

a) number of commits

b) number of assigned tasks

c) the total number of tasks

d) the degree of importance (of committed tasks), where the latter is defined as follows:
- 0: Unimportant commits, e.g. comments.
- 1: Minor commits, e.g. changing the names of functions or variables.
- 2: Important commits, e.g. adding new functions into classes.
- 3: Very important commits, e.g. such as adding a class.

Out of convenience for the marker, we have still grouped issues/PRs by GitHub Milestones to help with organizing which Iteration they correspond to from the project description. We will also add labels to each task to further show how work was divided evenly between team members.
